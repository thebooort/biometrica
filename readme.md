### Biometrics: Your body threatens your privacy
 These are the slides of my talk in JASYP (Anonymity Privacy and Security Conference) celebrated in ETSIIT: https://etsiit.ugr.es/ (Granada University) by three computer science groups: https://www.fwhibbit.es/
 http://hackandbeers.es/ and https://interferencias.tech/ 
 I also work with Interferencias in talks and courses.
